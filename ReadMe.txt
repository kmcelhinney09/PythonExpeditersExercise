In this project there is the script file containing my python code that I wore to achieve the objective set out for me.
I wanted to do the exercise in a language I was most comfortable with so that I could get the design patterns down
before I approached doing it in Java. This script is written using the latest version of Python 3 as of (March 2022) and
only utilizes the built-in csv library. The script can easily be run if you have Python 3 installed and executable on your
path.

    I also wanted to try my hand at creating an executable file. This file along with the data input file it needs is
found in the executable directory inside the project directory. This executable file is designed to be used on a machine
running windows. To run the executable file you need to navigate to the directory that it is in and double-click on the
file. It will process the input_file.txt and crate and output_file.txt.
